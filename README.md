# OPSEC-Term-Project
The purpose of this project is for students to learn vulnerability in modern operating systems and how to exploit them. You are required to research any known Linux kernel vulnerability, and then build a kernel image with such vulnerability. You will then find a suitable exploit that has the capacity to violate the security of your new code.
