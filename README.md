# OPSEC-Term-Project
The purpose of this project is for students to learn vulnerability in modern operating systems and how to exploit them. You are required to research any known Linux kernel vulnerability, and then build a kernel image with such vulnerability. You will then find a suitable exploit that has the capacity to violate the security of your new code. 

LINUX KERNEL VULNERABILITY AND EXPLOITATION
Project Description: The purpose of this project is for students to learn vulnerability in modern operating systems and how to exploit them. Students are required to research any known Linux kernel vulnerability, and then build a kernel image with such vulnerability. You will then find a suitable exploit that has the capacity to violate the security of your new code. 

PROJECT TASKS KERVEL VULNRERABILITY AND EXPLOITATION
Your task is to pick a Linux vulnerability of your choice, then go to the Exploit Database, search and download an already designed exploit for your chosen CVE. Compile and test the exploit on a virtual machine.
The link to the database for Linux kernel vulnerabilities is here.
