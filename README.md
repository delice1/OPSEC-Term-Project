# OPSEC-Term-Project
The purpose of this project is for students to learn vulnerability in modern operating systems and how to exploit them. You are required to research any known Linux kernel vulnerability, and then build a kernel image with such vulnerability. You will then find a suitable exploit that has the capacity to violate the security of your new code. 

COSC 440 - OPERATING SYSTEM SECURITY PROJECT
DUE DATE – NOVEMBER 29TH, 2018
PRESENTATION DATES – DECEMBER 4TH & 6TH, 2018
LINUX KERNEL VULNERABILITY AND EXPLOITATION
Project Description: The purpose of this project is for students to learn vulnerability in modern operating systems and how to exploit them. You are required to research any known Linux kernel vulnerability, and then build a kernel image with such vulnerability. You will then find a suitable exploit that has the capacity to violate the security of your new code. 
Project Description: You are required to work in group of two students.
PROJECT TASKS KERVEL VULNRERABILITY AND EXPLOITATION
The Task:
The CVE database has an excellent resource for learning security vulnerabilities in various operating systems. It has detailed explanation of every known vulnerability including its complexity, the operating system, and version affected and the overall impact of the vulnerability on the general security objectives (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Authenticity, Non-repudiation, and Accountability).

Your task is to pick a Linux vulnerability of your choice, then go to the Exploit Database, search and download an already designed exploit for your chosen CVE. Compile and test the exploit on a virtual machine.
The link to the database for Linux kernel vulnerabilities is here.

Hints:
Before testing your exploit, check your kernel version to make sure it is affected by your chosen vulnerability. Most of the exploit will require you to build a Linux kernel from scratch to get an unpatched image.

WHAT TO SUBMIT 
Turn in your compiled exploit, powerpoint presentation of your project and a 3-page workshop paper style report.
Report:
On the due date, each group will submit a formal report itemizing their exploitation steps. Please ensure you that your report include the following information:
•	The kernel version, Linux distro used, any extra settings and dependencies needed.
•	The detailed cause of the vulnerability.
•	Walk-through of the exploitation code and how the exploitation is achieved
•	How did you raise privilege?
•	Any clean-up steps?
•	A detailed explanation of how the vulnerability affect CIA triad?

Presentation:
On a schedule presentation date, each group will have ten minutes to present their project. The presentation should capture a detailed summary of the report. Use the provided vulnerability demo slides a model for your presentation.

Demo:
Each group will have 5 minutes to execute their exploit for the class.
